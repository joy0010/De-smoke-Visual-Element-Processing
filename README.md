The original code was from [https://github.com/ErinChen1/EPDN](https://github.com/ErinChen1/EPDN).

Generally, models modified by me for training is in this file: `models/networks.py`. And, they were marked as created by me using this comment: *`# Creator: Jiayi Zhao`*.

Datasets should be put into folder `datasets/testdata` which is empty to save space, but datasets can be downloaded from [https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-standard?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-standard?authuser=0).

The trained models is under folder *`Pix2PixHD_modify`*. In detail, the Pix2PixHD model is under folder *`Pix2PixHD`*, the de-smoke model is under folder *`desmoke`*, and the single-scale model is under folder *`singlescale`*.



The evaluation code is under folder *`EvaluateCode_Matlab`*.  *`eval_indoor.m`* and  *`eval_outdoor.m`* are writen by myself, and *`psnr.m`* and  *`ssim.m`*  are download from  [https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-standard?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-standard?authuser=0).
